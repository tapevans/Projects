Comments on submission:
* I don't know why but on my git submissions it started saying it was Peter Weddle. I am using the same computer he was but I am logged into my account so I don't know why his name is on it
* This code runs but by no means is it working correctly. If charge fraction is increased to say 0.9, the solver will break
